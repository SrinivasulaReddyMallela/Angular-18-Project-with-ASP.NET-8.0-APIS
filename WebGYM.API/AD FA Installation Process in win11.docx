If “RSAT: Active Directory Federation Services and Directory Services Tools” is not showing in the optional features on your Windows 11 machine, here are a few steps you can try:

1. Check Windows Version
Ensure that your Windows 11 version supports RSAT. RSAT tools are typically available in Windows 11 Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions.

2. Enable RSAT via PowerShell
You can try installing RSAT using PowerShell:

Open PowerShell as Administrator:
Right-click on the Start button and select Windows Terminal (Admin) or PowerShell (Admin).
Run the following command:
Get-WindowsCapability -Name RSAT* -Online | Add-WindowsCapability -Online

3. Use DISM Tool
If PowerShell doesn’t work, you can use the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM):

Open Command Prompt as Administrator:
Right-click on the Start button and select Command Prompt (Admin).
Run the following command:
dism /online /add-capability /capabilityname:Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0

4. Check for Windows Updates
Ensure your system is up to date:

Go to Settings > Windows Update.
Check for updates and install any pending updates.
5. Group Policy Settings
Sometimes, Group Policy settings might restrict the installation of optional features:

Open Group Policy Editor:
Press Win + R, type gpedit.msc, and press Enter.
Navigate to:
Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Specify settings for optional component installation and component repair.
Enable the policy and set it to Download repair content and optional features directly from Windows Update instead of Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).
6. Manual Download
If none of the above methods work, you can manually download the RSAT tools from the Microsoft Download Center.
